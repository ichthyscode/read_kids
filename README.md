# Reading Practice App

## Purpose

This Flutter application is designed to help children practice and improve their reading skills in German. It provides a fun, interactive way for young learners to engage with words, enhancing their vocabulary and reading fluency.

## Target Audience

This app is primarily intended for:

- Young children learning to read in German

## How It Works

1. Words are presented one at a time on the screen.
2. The user (child) attempts to read the word.
3. If read correctly, the user or supervising adult presses the "Richtig" (Correct) button.
4. If read incorrectly, they press the "Falsch" (Incorrect) button.
5. Points are awarded for correct readings and deducted for incorrect ones.
6. Incorrectly read words can be repeated for additional practice.

## Technical Details
